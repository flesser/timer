# Simple Timer

All you agile practitioners, you know these nice devices which can be placed on the desk and show the remaining time in the current time box.

Regrettably, whenever you need it, you left it home. And if only, because it is too large to transport in your case.

Now you can use this small application to use it without needing to carry more than you already have - your computer.
